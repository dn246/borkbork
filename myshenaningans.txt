\f0\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 \uc0\u8232 Maybe we should have a sanity meter in the game. The game starts at a full bar. If it hits to zero then game over because you feel too guilty. Like the more dogs that you couldn't save in the fire in each mission and had to be burned to death the lower your sanity decreases. If you do end up saving a dog then the meter goes back up again.\
We should just fuck with people at one point in the game where they are forced to choose between saving one of two dogs in the fire or something. (Maybe depending on which dog you save, it leads to its own alternate route?)\
Anyways.\
At the start of the game, we should make it simple for people to play and get the hang of. Their main objective would just be about trying to put out fires with the puppies. They can have their sanity meter there but it's not really anything important because the game would be easy. They also have a large surplus of puppies so they don't have to worry about running out.\uc0\u8232 First Challenge :Oven Puppies\u8232 After a few missions we can start introducing how to get more puppies(school shooter puppy puts puppies in oven tutorial yay) it's not really a tutorial you just put a puppy in but oh well. We'll have like an oven in the room or something but we'll say it's broken which is why it couldn't be used throughout the first missions until now or some silly other silly excuse. I didn't really think through much on the point of reproducing more puppies in the oven but I guess we should limit the use of how many puppies they can get from the oven or else people could just make like a shit ton of puppies and just never have to worry about running out of puppies in a mission and making things a little too easy. Also then it would just be pointless to do all this because it's less work to just make puppies a limitless supply from the hose than this.\u8232 ***for now: find a more thought out plan for the puppy oven system\
Second Challenge: Burning puppies\uc0\u8232 I guess after we do a few missions where puppy numbers is vital and all that jazz and people learn how to manage their puppy supply. The next thing is for them to be conscious of their sanity meter. We can start giving reports in the start of each mission on dogs that are still in the burning building. It's not mandatory I guess to save them but if they die the meter decreases. Some of the reports come with where the puppy was last seen in the building as a hint to where they could be found. Each puppy has their own time limit on how long they can survive in the fire so planning is important. If the fire gets put out before the puppies run out of time then I guess they don't technically die??? (Or do they?? Idk let's figure this out ) also each puppy barks so the closer you are to a puppy the louder you can hear them which helps in finding where they are. Saving puppies will help up your meter.\
Some of the buildings there are hidden puppies that aren't in the reports. If they die then it won't bring down your meter but if you save them then your meter goes up yay. This kind of helps get people explore the buildings more throughly because Maya is hard so they should at least appreciate the work put into the buildings. \uc0\u8232 Hidden puppies can be like a mistress in the closet that like the husband has hidden when his wife came home early\'a0 and couldn't bring it to himself to report the extra person to the police. A burglar that snuck in through the window before the fire started and now is trapped. Some kid hiding at home skipping school. Idk we'll figure it out. \u8232 Puppies unite yay. \
