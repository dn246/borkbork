Target Audience - Teenagers-young adults, rated T.
	not much swearing

THEMES
======================================================================
Dark existencial moments, covered with cutsey and fun visuals and dialogue 

cutscenes where you get super-intense close ups of hyper-realistic dogs
"N-NANI!?"

our GDD is snippets of facebook chats
where was god

SETTING
======================================================================
All-animal cutesy city that seems really flamable 


CAST
======================================================================
Domino - police chief
omg
nachos
these are puppies
wearing yellow
its perfect
nachos
ketchup
westchester
xxPussySlayerxx

They can have a crew
Like idk 5 dogs
They can be cliches of game crews
Like the leader and the tank

I want the leader pup to be adorably brash and determined
I'll make cute game-y sound effects while at work or something, fuck it
of course you need the cool one
oh my god fucking

To compensate his insecurities of being left alone and abused
emo hair on that other one, he keeps trying to be tough and edgy but is really bad at it

the firedogs should be really popular in the town, that would make sense for the main character wanting to be one, since by that logic, if everyone loves the firepups, and he becomes one of the best, he'll always be loved

Ong
Omg
he was too soft and kept losing girls he liked
or someshit like that
picked on, fuck it

In the leader pup's arc he gets triggered and there's a cut scene where he has flashbacks of a picture of an abandoned puppy that says free
In a cardboard box

Maybe he runs off in the middle of his arc so idk so now you have no leader to give you instructions so you have to pick one of the crew members to be a leader for that part and if you pick Sasuke he tells you to not do anything and let the building burn

childhood bully a main antagonist, like the leader of some other fire group that torments them, it's all good

Oh I forgot to add in the game as we advance we should add things like specific rooms we have to save where we have to put out the fire in that room at a time limit because there's probably a little girl there trapped and if we run out of time in that room there's a terrifying yelping puppy sound

Not required to save her but we should motivate people to try to save the puppies trapped in a room

also, one of them ahve to be Nacho

his mommy calls him chestnut
i mean catslayer

OH MY GOD
THE EDGY BOY IS RPI
okay so we got 3(4?) dogs so far?
leader pup
can he be chestnut
weird kid
and edgy pup
leader pup is a leader which is why hes embarassed why people call him chestnut
westchester
is the edgy pup also the brains?
it would be funny if we do the typical stereotypes of like a group like we have leader, brains, tank, school shooter, and some guy
the tank can be a huge dog that we are sure he is not a puppy despite how he claims hes the youngest one


shes like remember that toy you wanted when you were 5 i bought 10 of them and hes like mom im an adult
puppy wise
hes arc could be that it just happened to be mothers day and he visits her
or its her house that got caught on fire
and she bugs out because shes like now my son is gonna leave me because house

STORY OUTLINE
======================================================================
New Barksdale is a predominantly puppy-run town ruled by an insane dictator-mayor that nobody seems 
to care exists. 
The town worships the Fire Puppies like gods.

The game opens up with small dog sitting beside a box along the road
Smoke starts to drift in and the dog starts to flip out right as the Fire dogs drive past towards
the fire.
[Intro Gameplay]
The confused small dog shows up in time to see the fires get put out and the Fire dogs getting praised
by the rest of the town

Flash forward presumably several years later, Domino is
...
... 
[Introduction to further gameplay mechanics with Domino]

The player is then alerted to the upcoming festival where the top rookie team gets to lead the 
festivities, main dog super-excited
Introduced to ace rival squad that looks down on the main team

[Side missions encountering fires across the city, multiple people remark the increase in fires
throughout the city]

Depending on the player's performance, they either don't get to lead the parade.
Domino takes note of the main dog's overzealousness, chastising him for it, the rival team
gets to lead the parade much to his dismay.

Main pup mopes around the city for a while, the rest of the crew tries to operate without him
but probably fail, meanwhile 
[Main Boi comes across a burning building; gameplay going through burning building]
Saves a trapped mobster cat, brings her back to the fire station poorly disguised as a dog-chan
Main dawg tells the elite squad that the mob is behind the fires and they move out, the 
rookies all get put on stand-by because it's too dangerous

[Pups probably sneak out after the cat, suspicious of where she goes out the nights]

Main Squad disappear in a fire because the main squad wasn't around

[all the rookies have to be dispatched to smaller stations across the town, and eventually the 
main fire station burns down as well]

The puppies manage to salvage sardine cans and other evidence from the fire station fire, and 
the cat tells them their lair is by the docks, in the old tuna fish plant that burned down 
years ago

[The puppies along with rival squad confront the mob boss and his goons, puppies licking most of 
them into submission]

The Boss curses the elite fire squad for letting his favourite fish place burn before disappearing
into the smoke, never to be seen again, chased by the Friendly-Cat

In the end, the Pups get their jackass parade after rescuing the elites from the basement of 
the fish plant




======================================================================
Underdog-rivalry story
story about rivalry and proving your worth
still kind of want a kitty mafia somewhere in there

I want the all 4 dogs to be emotionless puppies with no thought and their whole objective is to lick things
Which is why there's this weird all 4 dog that somehow slipped away  and has been passing as a crew member
He is dangerous
He's the one that teaches you that you can replenish your puppies by putting dogs in the oven
really fucking dangerous
he'll be the one everyone theorizes about

Maybe one arc is that the dogs start talking about how the all 4 puppies are not sentient beings and has a whole debate on whether their life is worth being used as something to douse into fire

omg all the glass in their station is either cracked or has a mark on it to make it clear it's glass
We should put glass walls in the game and not tell.people and they have to figure it ojt


instead of like a firepup of the month thing, we should have something like
you know how you have parades and you have some police squad that's like
you know what I mean?
like a parade but the main thing in it would be the best rookie pup squad or something, that's a good goal for the little bastard

omg
but the question is, is he a fire-pup for the right reasons or is it only because of his selfish desire to not be left alone

omg
not really selfish
it's justified
but still

can the parade thingy be part of his arc in the game
yes
and omg

so we have these big story plots
maybe that's why like, his squad never gets it
because the pros see his twisted intentions

and we just make them as part of an arc in the game so its all organized

oh yeah
what is we just give hints that he smothered her
like
itll be a text secrence where we keep replaying some dialougue like he notices her sleeping peaceful on that pillow
and then it just showing a shot of him and a pillow on loop
and eventually be like oh she stopped breathing
what if we have an item menu at the side and we are suppose to click on the pillow and his mom


i'm gonna make the cat mob super cutesy and nonthreatening but for some reason everyone's really scared of them

maybe they are threatening because they do not care
like
thats the face of a cat that can set the world on fire
puppy lick them into submission

and still play the piano
they all have the same expression

those black souless cat eyes
yes
now that's fucked up

which is why the puppies find them so disturbing
like those kids that say fucked up shit but cannot comprehend the world yet to feel why its fucked up

"haha...just call me the pussy slayer guys..!"

GAMEPLAY
======================================================================
1st person/over the shoulder gameplay with third person hub world in the fire station and 
maybe a few other places

actually, going off that
depending on which dog you go on the mission with/as you get those different powerups

Maybe shoot out 3 dogs at once?
power-ups

I'll think of an algorithm and see how that plays out
